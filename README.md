## Description

**BioGénius** is a technical project within the Robotique UdeS group that focuses on designing a lightweight and powerful exoskeleton system. This innovative system provides support to the legs, hips, and back, making walking and load handling easier. Notably, our prototype led the team to secure the first-place position at the Applied Collegiate Exoskeleton (ACE) Competition in the United States in both 2022 and 2023.

Founded in the fall of 2019 by two bioengineering enthusiasts, BioGénius has grown into a team of over fifteen members, bringing together expertise from various engineering disciplines and cohorts. This project represents a pioneering endeavor at the undergraduate engineering level in Quebec.

## Hardware

Our system comprises the following key hardware components:

- **Touch Screen (HMI)**: NX3224F024_11
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32
- **Inertial Measurement Units**: BNO085
- **Motor Drives**: DBH-15

## Getting Started

Getting started with our project is a straightforward process. Simply clone the repository.

## Testing

To ensure the robustness of our system, you can run unit tests on all components by using the Test class.
